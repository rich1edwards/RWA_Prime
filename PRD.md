5. Use Cases

- Use Case 1: The First RWA Investment (Investor Focus)
- Actor: Ivan, the Investor.
- Scenario: Ivan is new to RWAs and wants to earn a stable yield. He uses the RWA-Prime Explorer tier on his mobile phone to view the market overview and screen for Tokenized Treasuries. He compares two options, looking at their simple 7-day price prediction and overall Risk Score. Feeling confident, he makes his first purchase and adds it to his manual portfolio tracker to monitor its performance.
- Use Case 2: Advanced Opportunity Discovery (Power User Focus)
- Actor: Diana, the Researcher.
- Scenario: Diana wants to find higher-yield private credit tokens. She uses the Professional tier's Advanced Screener to filter for assets in the "Private Credit" class with an APY > 10%, a Composite Risk Score < 40, and a positive 30-day price prediction. She identifies three promising tokens and uses the Comparative Analysis Tool to evaluate their on-chain liquidity and holder distribution before deciding to invest.
- Use Case 3: Institutional Due Diligence & Reporting (Professional Focus)
- Actor: Tom, the Analyst.
- Scenario: Tom is tasked with evaluating tokenized U.S. Treasuries for a client's portfolio. He uses the Enterprise tier's Core Asset Pages for BlackRock's BUIDL and Ondo's OUSG. He drills down into the Detailed Risk Score Breakdown, focusing on Counterparty and Regulatory risk sub-scores. Satisfied with the risk profile, he uses the "Generate Report" feature to create a PDF summary, which he shares with his investment committee.

7. User Interaction and Design


7.1. Design Philosophy

The success of the RWA-Prime platform hinges on its ability to serve its primary audience—the RWA investor—while also providing powerful tools for secondary users like professional analysts. The UI/UX must therefore be exceptionally easy to use, building trust through clarity and transparency.2
This dictates a design philosophy centered on progressive disclosure.6 The initial view for an investor should be clean, high-level, and intuitive, while allowing power users and professionals to "drill-down" for more granular data.

7.2. Key UI Components

- Modular Dashboard: A customizable, widget-based dashboard where users can arrange components like "My Portfolio," "Market Overview," and "Watchlist".1
- Predictive Trajectory Chart: An interactive chart showing historical price, a 7/30-day forecast with a confidence interval, and overlays for key news or on-chain events.8
- Composite Risk Gauge: A visual, color-coded gauge (like a speedometer) that displays the 1-100 risk score, with clickable sections to reveal sub-score details.9
- Explainable AI (XAI) Insights Card: A simple card listing the top positive and negative drivers for the current prediction and risk score in plain language.4
- Visualizations: Use of clear graphs, charts, and infographics (e.g., bubble charts for market cap vs. performance) to make complex data easily digestible.1

7.3. User Journey and Personas

- Persona 1: "Ivan the Investor"
- Goal: To easily find, evaluate, and track stable, yield-bearing RWAs to grow his personal portfolio.
- Journey: Ivan logs into the mobile app to check his portfolio. He sees a news alert about a new tokenized treasury fund. He navigates to the asset page, reviews the high-level summary, the 7-day prediction, and the key drivers. The risk score is low, and the drivers are positive (e.g., "Strong institutional backing"). He decides to invest a small amount and adds the transaction to his portfolio tracker.
- Persona 2: "Diana the Researcher"
- Goal: To identify high-yield, potentially undervalued RWA opportunities and perform deep due diligence on their on-chain health and security.
- Journey: Diana uses the RWA Screener to filter for "Private Credit" tokens with a yield above 8% and a Composite Risk Score below 50. She sorts the results by the 30-day predicted price increase. Intrigued by a token, she navigates to its detailed asset page. She bypasses the high-level summary and drills down into the "On-Chain Analytics" tab to analyze holder distribution and DEX liquidity depth. She then reviews the "Technical Risk" breakdown to see the smart contract audit history before setting a real-time alert to notify her if any wallet transfers more than $500,000 of the token to an exchange.

8. Technical Specifications


8.1. System Architecture

A decoupled, microservices-based architecture will be implemented, consisting of five primary layers:
- Data Ingestion Layer: Microservices connecting to external APIs, using a message queue (e.g., Apache Kafka) for real-time streams.30
- Data Processing & Storage Layer: A "Medallion Architecture" using a data lake (e.g., AWS S3) for raw data, a stream processing engine (Apache Spark) for cleaning, and a combination of a Time-Series Database and a Relational Database for aggregated, query-optimized data.31
- Analytics & Prediction Engine: A containerized application managed by Kubernetes, running Python-based ML (LSTM, ARIMA) and NLP (BERT) models for prediction, sentiment analysis, and risk scoring.33
- Backend API Layer: A central API gateway (e.g., FastAPI) to serve data to the frontend, handle authentication, and manage user requests.
- Frontend UI: A modern single-page application (SPA) built with React or Vue.js, using libraries like D3.js for interactive visualizations and WebSockets for real-time updates.8

8.2. Model Validation

A rigorous model validation and continuous improvement strategy will be implemented:
- Backtesting: Use Python libraries like backtesting.py to simulate model performance against historical data, mitigating for optimization, look-ahead, and survivorship biases.23
- Cross-Validation: Employ rolling-forward cross-validation (TimeSeriesSplit) to ensure model robustness on unseen data.39
- Continuous Retraining: A dual-cadence model retraining protocol will be used: periodic (e.g., weekly) retraining to adapt to market shifts and trigger-based retraining when live performance degrades below a set threshold.42

9. Dependencies

The platform's functionality is critically dependent on data from the following external APIs:
- Price Data: CoinAPI, Financial Modeling Prep (FMP), Finazon.46
- On-Chain Data: Amberdata, Bitquery, RWA.io API.49
- Economic Indicators: Trading Economics API, World Bank API.52
- News & Sentiment Feeds: NewsAPI.ai, Tradefeeds Crypto News API.55
